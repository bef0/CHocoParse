List of miscellaneous unimplemented features.

* Include statements.
* Error handling API, e.g. storing error state
* Recursion depth limiting

* Test suite:
  - Parser tests using custom tree reader that logs calls
  - System tests that build the final tree, then dump
  - Compare actual v expected output

* Post-processing stage where variables, concatenations and overwrites
* are resolved.
  1. Build tree with key/values stored in file order
     - Keys are plain strings.
     - Key path expressions expanded to nested objects.
     - Original index is stored alongside key
  2. Do sort of all keys in all objects by (key, orig_ix)
  3. Remove overwritten keys, concat tokens from appended keys
  4. Resolve varaibles
